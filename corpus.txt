This is a sample corpus for word prediction using N-gram models. N-gram models are commonly used in natural language processing.
They can predict the next word based on the previous words in the sequence.
In this example, we'll use bigram and trigram models to demonstrate word prediction.
Word prediction can be useful in various applications such as text generation and autocomplete.
N-gram models require a good amount of training data to make accurate predictions.
